# I still don't believe I read manga and also completed in 2 days.

Actually I like watching anime but don't generally read manga but when I watched solo levelling I was really curious to read it's manga(it's called manhwa as it is Korean but I'll stick to familiar word manga) so I started on Sunday and quickly got engrossed in it that I completed half of it ~90 chapters and remaining today.
