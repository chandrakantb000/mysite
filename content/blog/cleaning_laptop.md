# Laptop temperature rose due to dust or....

From few days my laptop starting heating like just using normally the temperature rose upto 70 degrees initally I thought maybe its due to summer but the next day it was 80 degrees so I remembered I haven't cleaned the laptop from a long time so opened the laptop and saw a lot of dust around cpu fan cleaned it and started the laptop....

Lol the temps are same but then I looked at the windows update and that was the issue :P
