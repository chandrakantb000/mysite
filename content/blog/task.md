# Just completed a task given by a company.

Doing this task taught me a lot of things, e.g. always stick to fundamentals, read official documentation carefully, even though the task looks big plan your approach and it becomes relatively simple. At first I thought would I really be able to do the task, as soon as one day passed thinking I came back to senses and planned the approach did it little by little. More info is present [here](https://nightfury000.github.io/task_notes/Task).

Also the quartz tool came in handy to write documentation to push documentation online from obsidian to quartz hosted on github pages.
