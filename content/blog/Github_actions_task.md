# Failed to completed pre-interview task

So the task was regarding containerizing and creating image of the script(it runs and results as webapp) deploying it in Kubernetes environment, setting up CICD for the given web application using github actions and last was to secure the site using ssl.
	I did setup CI part like automated building of image but while CD deploying in Kubernetes environment there was an error("error validating deployment").
So I need to study more about Kubeconfig part how to connect these kubernetes cluster to automate CD part using Github actions.
