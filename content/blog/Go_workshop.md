# Attended the Intro Workshop  of Go

**Reason to learn Go** - Most of the tools used in DevOps are written in Go that interests me also maybe in future I would be able to contribute them. 
The workshop was amazing, got to know about various benefits about Go, why it's the best backend language, its use cases etc. plus learning programming by self vs in workshop with peers invokes a different enthusiasm.
